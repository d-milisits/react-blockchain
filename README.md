# Getting Started with Create React App

                      This is a cool little project I whipped up during one of
                      my deep dives into the blockchain world. It's a slick way
                      to track live historical data for major cryptocurrencies.
                      It's not just about feeding my crypto curiosity though â€“
                      it's also been a great way to keep my React skills sharp
                      and have some fun with data visualization.

## Setup

To run this project, you will need to add your own `REACT_APP_API_KEY` from the CoinGecko API to a `.env` file in the root directory:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2. Add the following line to the file, replacing `your_api_key` with your actual API key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
